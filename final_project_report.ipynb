    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The pharmaceutical industry, often referred to as \"Big Pharma,\" is a crucial sector of the global economy that plays a significant role in advancing healthcare and treating illnesses. The industry's growth and sustainability can be attributed to a steady stream of new drugs and therapies that address a range of diseases and health conditions. However, bringing a new drug to market is a complex and costly process that takes an average of 10-15 years and can cost over $1 billion in research and development. Moreover, the vast majority of drugs fail in the early testing phases, never making it past the preliminary stages and into clinical testing. As a result, significant financial resources must continually be invested in the process of developing new drugs and therapies. This investment is essential for companies to maintain a competitive edge in the industry and to stay ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmaceutical companies, especially smaller ones, are known to have highly volatile stock prices due to a variety of factors. Since the development of new drugs and therapies is a complex and costly process, it is subject to a range of uncertainties, including regulatory hurdles, clinical trial results, and patent expirations. As a result, the stock prices of these companies can be highly sensitive to changes in market sentiment and news related to drug development and approval processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing trends in price fluctuations in pharmaceutical companies could yield a high Sharpe ratio trading strategy. This is because these companies often experience significant price swings in response to news related to their drug development pipelines, clinical trial results, and FDA drug approvals. By identifying patterns in these price movements, investors could potentially develop a trading strategy that generates good returns with low risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one significant determinant of price changes in pharmaceutical companies is the FDA drug approval process. The FDA is responsible for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new drugs before they can be marketed and sold to the public. The approval process can have a significant impact on a pharmaceutical company's stock price. If the FDA approves a new drug, it can lead to a significant increase in a company's stock price, as investors perceive the approval as a sign of the drug's potential commercial success. Conversely, if the FDA rejects a new drug, it can lead to a significant decline in a company's stock price, as investors perceive the rejection as a sign of the drug's potential commercial failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highly volatile stock prices of pharmaceutical companies could lead to high Sharpe ratios for specific trading strategies. For instance, a trading strategy that takes advantage of the price movements before and after an FDA drug approval could potentially generate high returns with relatively low risk. By buying the stock before the FDA approval and selling it shortly after the approval, traders could potentially capture the price increase and earn a profit. Similarly, by shorting the stock before the FDA rejection and covering the position after the rejection, traders could potentially capture the price decline and earn a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will address how analyzing and leveraging the news and trends within pharmaceutical industry can be an effective way to maximize the Sharpe ratio for trading strategies involving pharmaceutical companies. \n",

    "##### FDA Drug Approval Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the observations we are tracing to stock price, a general understanding of the full FDA approval process is necessary. This research is taken from drugwatch.com and the fda.gov website.\n",

    "<br />When wanting to bring a new drug to market, companies must file a **New Drug Application, or NDA**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incentive for pharmaceutical company**\n",
    "<br />A new patent is good for 20 years from the date the application is filed in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expedited review process**\n",
    "<br />Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) allows the FDA to collect fees from companies to expedite the drug-approval process.\n",
    "<br />Standard Review: Drug approval within 10 months.\n",
    "<br />Priority Review: Drug approval within 6 months.\n",
    "\n",

    "<br />Unexpected safety issues, manufacturing issues or a failure to prove a drugâ€™s effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The drug approval process**\n",
    "<br />Basic safety of drug is tested through chemical tests and animal tests.\n",
    "<br />Clinical trials consist of 3 phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Phase 1\n",
    "    - Length: Several months\n",
    "    - Participants: 20 to 100 healhy volunteers / people with disease\n",
    "    - Selectivity: 70% pass\n",
    "    - Intention: Test how drug interacts with human body, adjusting human dosage based on animal data, find out how much body can tolerate and acute side effects, how to best administer the drug to limit risks and maximize benefits\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Phase 2\n",
    "    - Length: Several months to 2 years \n",
    "    - Participants: Several hundred people with disease\n",
    "    - Selectivity: 33% pass\n",
    "    - Intention: Establish research questions, research methods, and design P3 research protocols, provide additional safety data. Note: this study is still not large enough to show whether drug will help treat the target condition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Phase 3\n",
    "    - Length: 1 to 4 years\n",
    "    - Participants: 300 to 3000\n",
    "    - Selectivity: 25-30% pass\n",
    "    - Intention: Test if it offers a treatment benefit to a specific population, \"Pivotal studies\", provides most safety data - reveals long term or rare side effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing of phase 3 means FDA approval is given and the drug is released to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Phase 4\n",
    "    - Several thousand volunteers\n",
    "    - Carried out once drug approved by FDA in _Post Market Safety Monitoring_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**\n",
    "<br />Medical Devices have Class I, II, III based on how invasive they are - Pharmaceutical companies are allowed to announce devices before approval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen, the most pivotal stage of the FDA approval process is phase 3, as this approval is followed by bringing the drugs to market and is tje most selective and long process."

    "From the FDA website, we use the past 10 years of drug approval data (see https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases) and match these with our ticker symbols and name collected previously. This requires some data cleaning, as the FDA data has company name abbreviations that do not match the company symbol or name from pharmaceutical_preparations.\n",
